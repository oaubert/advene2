============

The libadvene module depends on the following python libs:
  * SimpleTAL, from http://www.owlfish.com/software/simpleTAL/
  * lxml, from http://lxml.de/

Additionnaly, the following modules are recommended, but optional:
  * rdflib, from http://rdflib.net/

The advene module depends on libadvene plus the following libs:
  * pygobject, from http://pygtk.org/downloads.html

Installing dependencies with packages on Ubuntu/Debian
======================================================

  * SimpleTAL is provided by package python-simpletal
  * lxml is provided by package python-lxml
  * rdflib is only provided in an old version;
    you need to install it for example with pip (see below)
  * pygobject is provided by package python-gobject

Installing dependencies with pip on Ubuntu/Debian
=================================================

You may prefer to install the dependencies with pip (e.g. in a virtualenv).

  * SimpleTAL is not available on the standard repositories,
    but can be installed with

    pip install -f http://www.owlfish.com/software/simpleTAL/downloads/SimpleTAL-4.3.tar.gz SimpleTAL

  * lxml requires some compilation, so you need the following packages:
      python-dev gcc libxml2-dev libxslt-dev
    then simply
      pip install lxml

  * rdflib can be simply installed with
      pip install rdflib

  * as far as we know, there is no simple way to install pygobject with pip
