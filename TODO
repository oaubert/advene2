Needed improvements
===================

- R/W annotationtype.mimetype (could handle jokers such as None, '*' or text/*')

- auto-update of creator/created/contributor/modified. For package,
   update contributor/modified upon package saving.

- How to do package.get(foo) in TALES ? package/foo ? package/get/foo?

- How to express the same thing as matchFilter (essentially, which
   element does the view apply on).

Important improvements
======================

- finish the implementation of utest/core_package test_modify_X methods

- implement annotations.__in__(self, an_int)

- implement Package.get_by_uriref(uriref)

- export advene1 -> advene2 (in advene1)

- automatically fill creator/contributor and dates metadata
  and make those metadata defaulted to ""

- prevent annotations/relations to be untyped

- implement ID generator

- fix problem in utest/serpar.py with "created" and "modified" metadata

- check in can_reference that "embeded" elements are not references outside
  their embeding elements

- align backend granularity on notification granularity (i.e. tell the backend
  to change a specific attribute in an element)

- add parameters X_with_prefix and X_exclude_prefix in backend_methods
  (id_with_prefix, id_exclude_prefix, media_with_prefix, etc...)

- augment backend method iter_tags_with_element with attributes tag_with_prefix
  and tag_exclude_prefix ; may be symetric iter_elements_with_tags

- implement read or write locking, "force", and "readonly" in _SqliteBackend

- implement content handlers for queries and models, in the same way it has
  been done for views

- ensure that the import "cam" is never renamed

- advene_zip: make unit test with accented filenames stored in the
   package, to ensure that there is no problem with multiplaform
   encodings

Minor improvements, to do one day
=================================

Backend related
---------------

- add indexes in the SQL schema (Annotations.f_begin at least)
  and test its efficiency

- implement count_lists_with_items and update all_group and own_group

Misc
----

- remove unused code in advene/utils once we are sure we won't use it

- remove "unstable and experimental" in parser and serializer docstrings (once
  it is stabilized and tested, that is ;)

- use notification of events, once implemented, to clean the package root
  created by parsers/advene_zip.py and content.py

- in advene/utils/files.py, improve if necessary the URL proxy

Open questions and remarks
==========================

- Olivier would like collection-like objects (own-group, all-group, relations,
  lists...) to implement __getitem__. I do not see the real added value since,
  if you know the id, you would rather call package[id] than package.own[id]
  or package.own.annotations[id]. To discuss...

- from Jul 13 2007 to Aug 03 2007, module advene.model.core.dirty was used to
  delay accesses to the backend, in order to make modifications more
  responsive. It appeared that this was no a good idea: the backend is not only
  used for storage, but also for *indexing*. As a consequence, many methods
  rely on the backend for efficient retrieval of sequences of objects, hence
  requiring the cleaning of involved objects, and hindering access for the
  sake of modifications. So that functionality has been discarded. Should it
  become necessary in the future (the current sqlite backend seems to be
  responsive enough, anyway), it should probably be implemented at the backend
  level itself.
